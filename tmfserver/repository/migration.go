// like '20251102T203201'.
// The migrations are ordered by timestamp before being applied. This guarantees that migrations are
// applied in the correct order, independent from the order in which the init() functions have run.
// Both an UP migration and a DOWN migration can be registered, with nil if no action has to be taken.
// If a registered migration function returns an error, the migration is cancelled.
// Each migration function is run inside a SQLite SAVEPOINT, which allows nesting in case that the
// migration function needs nested savepoints.

// RunMigrationsUp ensures the database migrations table exists and applies any pending migrations.
//
// RunMigrationsUp performs the following steps:
//  1. Ensures the migrations table exists by executing createMigrationsTableSQL.
//  2. Reads the version of the last applied migration from the migrations table
//     using "SELECT version FROM migrations ORDER BY version DESC LIMIT 1".
//     If the table is empty, no rows is treated as no previously applied migrations.
//  3. Collects available migrations from the global `migrations` map, sorts their
//     keys lexicographically, and iterates them in that order.
//  4. Skips any migration whose version is less than or equal to the last applied version.
//  5. For each pending migration, calls applyMigration(db, migration) to apply it,
//     logs successful application, and stops on the first error returned by applyMigration.
//
// Notes and expectations:
//   - Version comparison is lexicographical string comparison; migration version keys must be
//     chosen so that lexicographical order corresponds to the intended application order.
//   - Recommended version format is a timestamp in the format YYYYMMDDTHHMMSS (YearMonthDayTHoursMinutesSeconds),
//     like '20251102T203201'.

// applyMigration runs a single migration inside a SQLite savepoint and records it
// in the migrations table. It creates a random, unguessable SAVEPOINT so user
// migration code can create nested savepoints safely. The function defers a plain
// ROLLBACK so that if any step fails before the savepoint is released, changes are
// undone; releasing the savepoint makes the deferred rollback a no-op.
//
// The function performs these steps in order:
//  1. Generate a random savepoint name and execute "SAVEPOINT <name>".
//  2. Execute migration.up(db). If that returns an error, the error is logged
//     and returned (the deferred rollback will undo any partial changes).
//  3. Insert the migration version into the migrations table.
//  4. Execute "RELEASE <name>" to commit the savepoint and persist changes.
//
// Parameters:
//
//	db        - a *sql.DB connected to the SQLite database to operate on.
//	migration - a oneMigration describing the migration to execute (provides up
//	            and the version to record).
//
// Errors:
//
//	Any error encountered while starting the savepoint, running the migration,
//	recording the version, or releasing the savepoint is returned to the caller.
//	The function ensures uncommitted changes are rolled back on error.
